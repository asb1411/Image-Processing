# PALMPRINT RECOGNITION #

This folder includes the MATLAB implementation of 5 different feature extraction algorithms.
1. Mean
2. AAD (Average Absolute Deviation)
3. GMF (Gaussian Membership Function)
4. SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Feature)
5. SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform)

It also includes the code to test the features using SVM and KNN along with the file to extract palmprint ROI.
The features extractions is tested across IIT-D and PolyU datasets of palmprint.
